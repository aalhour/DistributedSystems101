   * Distributed system
   * Manages distributed systems
   * Running on distributed systems
   * Interacting with distributed systems

** Why this talk?

   Parallels with Crypto 101

   * Field considered exclusive domain of experts
   * Abstinence-only education doesn't work
     * Lots of papers, material out there
     * Not organized for self-teaching
   * We can no longer afford not to care

*** Disconnect between practice and theory

    * Many theoreticians ignore practice
    * Many practitioners ignore theory

** Distributed Systems 101

   "Just enough" distributed systems

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   * to whet your appetite
   * to shoot yourself in the foot

** What is a distributed system anyway?

   A system is distributed if a machine I've never heard of can cause
   my program to fail.

   /Leslie Lamport/

** A paradox

   * Why do people build them? Reliability!
   * Practitioners' primary concern? Failure!

* Caveat emptor

** Bad horror movie

   Don't go into the basement!

** Do you actually need one?

   Single machine performance is /great/!

* Impossibility results

** FLP

* CAP

** Pick any two!

   * Consistency
   * Availability
   * Partition tolerance

** You can't sacrifice partition tolerance

** So, pick any two

   As long as it's AP or CP ;-)

** Reality

* Components

  (High and low level)

** Queues

** Consensus protocols

*** Set partitioning

*** Examples

** CRDTs

*** Previously: CAP

    * Presented as trade-off: C versus A
    * Doesn't explain what we can do /on/ that line
    * CRDTs: wonderful modern example of what we can do

* Conclusion

** Why distributed systems?

   Because you have /no other options/.

   (This happens somewhat often.)

* Questions?
